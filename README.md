# Canvas JavaScript Game Engine Demo

This is a simple demo of a game engine written in TypeScript, that uses a HTML5 canvas to render the game.
The code is based on the work done by the guys over at [coopmode.dev](https://www.coopmode.dev/) and their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DrewConley).

My version differs in small ways, but the core concepts are the same.
I've chosen to use TypeScript and swapped out some code for more modern syntax when I got the chance.
